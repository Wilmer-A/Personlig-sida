      <p>
        Formula 1 2020 Statistics Archive is a website where I store information
        about the 2020 Formula 1 season. It can be used to for example learn
        some of the most important things to know if you are new to Formula 1,
        or to check where and when the next race is. Currently there are three
        tables where you can find information about the race calendar, which
        teams are competing and which tyres are used.
